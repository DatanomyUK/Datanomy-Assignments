# Technical Assessment: Power Platform/Cloud Solution Architect
## Objective:
This assessment evaluates your ability to design a solution using Power Platform and cloud technologies to address a finance-related business problem. Please make necessary assumption where required to complete this assessment. A key criteria for evaluation is your ability to go beyond user requirements and deliver a solution that is scalable and can handle exceptions that may not be covered by the requirments by business users. 
## Scenario:
A financial services company, "Global Finance Corp" (GFC), needs to modernize its expense reporting and approval process. Currently, employees submit expense reports via email and paper, leading to:
- Manual data entry and processing.Lack of visibility into the approval status.
- Delayed reimbursements.
- Difficulty in generating accurate reports for analysis.
- GFC wants to implement a new system to streamline this process, improve efficiency, and enhance reporting capabilities.
## Provided Documents:
1. User Stories:
- US-001: As an employee, I want to easily submit expense reports online, including uploading receipts.
- US-002: As an employee, I want to see the status of my expense report (e.g., "Submitted," "Approved," "Rejected," "Paid").
- US-003: As a manager, I want to receive notifications when an expense report is submitted for my approval.
- US-004: As a manager, I want to be able to review and approve or reject expense reports online.
- US-005: As an accountant, I want to export expense report data to our accounting system.
- US-006: As an accountant, I want to generate reports on expense trends, such as spending by department, category, and time period.
- US-007: As a system administrator, I want to ensure that the expense reporting system complies with our company's expense policies.
2. Business Requirements:
- BR-001: The system must allow employees to submit expense reports online, including details such as expense date, category, amount, and supporting documentation (receipts).
- BR-002: The system must provide a workflow for expense report approval, including automated routing to the appropriate manager.
- BR-003: The system must allow managers to review, approve, or reject expense reports online, with the ability to add comments.
- BR-004: The system must provide notifications to employees regarding the status of their expense reports and to managers when reports are pending their approval.
- BR-005: The system must allow accountants to export expense report data in a format compatible with the company's accounting system (e.g., CSV, Excel).
- BR-006: The system must provide reporting capabilities to track expense trends, including spending by department, category, and time period.
- BR-007: The system must enforce company expense policies, such as spending limits and required documentation.
- BR-008: The system must be secure, with appropriate access controls and audit trails.
- BR-009: The system should be deployed in a cloud environment (Microsoft Azure).
## Tasks:
Based on the provided user stories and business requirements, please create the following documents:
- Solution Design Document (SDD): A high-level document describing the solution, including how it meets the business needs, its scope, and key components.
- Functional Design Document (FDD): Describe the system's functions from the user's perspective. Focus on what the system will do.
- Technical Design Document (TDD): Describe the technical architecture of the solution. Focus on how the system will be built, including technology choices, data model, integrations, and infrastructure.
## Guidelines:
- Power Platform Focus: Leverage Power Platform components (Power Apps, Power Automate, Dataverse) where appropriate.
- Cloud Integration: Utilize Microsoft Azure services to enhance the solution's scalability, security, and integration capabilities.
- Diagrams: Use diagrams (e.g., flowcharts) to illustrate your design.
- Detail: Provide sufficient detail to demonstrate your understanding of the requirements and your ability to design a robust solution.
- Assumptions: Clearly state any assumptions you make.
- Security: Address security considerations throughout your design, including authentication, authorization, and data protection.
- Integration: Assume the accounting system has an API for data transfer. Describe how the Power Platform solution will integrate with this API.
- Azure Deployment: Outline how the solution will be deployed to Azure.
## Deliverables:
- Solution Design Document (SDD)
- Functional Design Document (FDD)
- Technical Design Document (TDD)
